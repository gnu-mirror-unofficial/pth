<P><STRONG>Pth</STRONG> is a very portable
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX/ANSI-C</FONT> based library for Unix platforms which
provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple threads of
execution (aka `multithreading') inside event-driven applications. All threads
run in the same address space of the application process, but each thread has
its own individual program counter, run-time stack, signal mask and <CODE>errno</CODE>
variable.</P>
<P>The thread scheduling itself is done in a cooperative way, i.e., the threads
are managed and dispatched by a priority- and event-driven non-preemptive
scheduler. The intention is that this way both better portability and run-time
performance is achieved than with preemptive scheduling. The event facility
allows threads to wait until various types of internal and external events
occur, including pending
<FONT SIZE="-1">I/O</FONT> on file descriptors, asynchronous signals,
elapsed timers, pending
<FONT SIZE="-1">I/O</FONT> on message ports, thread and process termination,
and even results of customized callback functions.</P>
<P><STRONG>Pth</STRONG> also provides an optional emulation
<FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> for POSIX.1c threads
(`Pthreads') which can be used for backward compatibility to existing
multithreaded applications. See <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>'s <CODE>pthread(3)</CODE> manual page for
details.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="threading background"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Threading Background</A></H2></font>
<P>When programming event-driven applications, usually servers, lots of
regular jobs and one-shot requests have to be processed in parallel.
To efficiently simulate this parallel processing on uniprocessor
machines, we use `multitasking' -- that is, we have the application
ask the operating system to spawn multiple instances of itself. On
Unix, typically the kernel implements multitasking in a preemptive and
priority-based way through heavy-weight processes spawned with fork(2).
These processes usually do <EM>not</EM> share a common address space. Instead
they are clearly separated from each other, and are created by direct
cloning a process address space (although modern kernels use memory
segment mapping and copy-on-write semantics to avoid unnecessary copying
of physical memory).</P>
<P>The drawbacks are obvious: Sharing data between the processes is
complicated, and can usually only be done efficiently through shared
memory (but which itself is not very portable). Synchronization is
complicated because of the preemptive nature of the Unix scheduler
(one has to use <EM>atomic</EM> locks, etc). The machine's resources can be
exhausted very quickly when the server application has to serve too many
long-running requests (heavy-weight processes cost memory). And when
each request spawns a sub-process to handle it, the server performance
and responsiveness is horrible (heavy-weight processes cost time to
spawn). Finally, the server application doesn't scale very well with the
load because of these resource problems. In practice, lots of tricks
are usually used to overcome these problems - ranging from pre-forked
sub-process pools to semi-serialized processing, etc.</P>
<P>One of the most elegant ways to solve these resource- and data-sharing
problems is to have multiple <EM>light-weight</EM> threads of execution
inside a single (heavy-weight) process, i.e., to use <EM>multithreading</EM>.
Those <EM>threads</EM> usually improve responsiveness and performance of the
application, often improve and simplify the internal program structure,
and most important, require less system resources than heavy-weight
processes. Threads are neither the optimal run-time facility for all
types of applications, nor can all applications benefit from them. But
at least event-driven server applications usually benefit greatly from
using threads.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the world of threading"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The World of Threading</A></H2></font>
<P>Even though lots of documents exists which describe and define the world
of threading, to understand <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>, you need only basic knowledge about
threading. The following definitions of thread-related terms should at
least help you understand thread programming enough to allow you to use
<STRONG>Pth</STRONG>.</P>
<DL>
<DT><P><STRONG><A NAME="item_o_process_vs%2E_thread"><STRONG>o</STRONG> <STRONG>process</STRONG> vs. <STRONG>thread</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">A</FONT> process on Unix systems consists of at least the following fundamental
ingredients: <EM>virtual memory table</EM>, <EM>program code</EM>, <EM>program
counter</EM>, <EM>heap memory</EM>, <EM>stack memory</EM>, <EM>stack pointer</EM>, <EM>file
descriptor set</EM>, <EM>signal table</EM>. On every process switch, the kernel
saves and restores these ingredients for the individual processes. On
the other hand, a thread consists of only a private program counter,
stack memory, stack pointer and signal table. All other ingredients, in
particular the virtual memory, it shares with the other threads of the
same process.
<P></P>
<DT><P><STRONG><A NAME="item_o_kernel%2Dspace_vs%2E_user%2Dspace_threading"><STRONG>o</STRONG> <STRONG>kernel-space</STRONG> vs. <STRONG>user-space</STRONG> threading</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Threads on a Unix platform traditionally can be implemented either
inside kernel-space or user-space. When threads are implemented by the
kernel, the thread context switches are performed by the kernel without
the application's knowledge. Similarly, when threads are implemented in
user-space, the thread context switches are performed by an application
library, without the kernel's knowledge. There also are hybrid threading
approaches where, typically, a user-space library binds one or more
user-space threads to one or more kernel-space threads (there usually
called light-weight processes - or in short LWPs).
<P>User-space threads are usually more portable and can perform faster
and cheaper context switches (for instance via <CODE>swapcontext(2)</CODE> or
<CODE>setjmp(3)/longjmp(3))</CODE> than kernel based threads. On the other hand,
kernel-space threads can take advantage of multiprocessor machines and
don't have any inherent
<FONT SIZE="-1">I/O</FONT> blocking problems. Kernel-space threads are
usually scheduled in preemptive way side-by-side with the underlying
processes. User-space threads on the other hand use either preemptive or
non-preemptive scheduling.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><P><STRONG><A NAME="item_o_preemptive_vs%2E_non%2Dpreemptive_thread_schedul"><STRONG>o</STRONG> <STRONG>preemptive</STRONG> vs. <STRONG>non-preemptive</STRONG> thread scheduling</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
In preemptive scheduling, the scheduler lets a thread execute until a
blocking situation occurs (usually a function call which would block)
or the assigned timeslice elapses. Then it detracts control from the
thread without a chance for the thread to object. This is usually
realized by interrupting the thread through a hardware interrupt
signal (for kernel-space threads) or a software interrupt signal (for
user-space threads), like <CODE>SIGALRM</CODE> or <CODE>SIGVTALRM</CODE>. In non-preemptive
scheduling, once a thread received control from the scheduler it keeps
it until either a blocking situation occurs (again a function call which
would block and instead switches back to the scheduler) or the thread
explicitly yields control back to the scheduler in a cooperative way.
<P></P>
<DT><P><STRONG><A NAME="item_o_concurrency_vs%2E_parallelism"><STRONG>o</STRONG> <STRONG>concurrency</STRONG> vs. <STRONG>parallelism</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Concurrency exists when at least two threads are <EM>in progress</EM> at the
same time. Parallelism arises when at least two threads are <EM>executing</EM>
simultaneously. Real parallelism can be only achieved on multiprocessor
machines, of course. But one also usually speaks of parallelism or
<EM>high concurrency</EM> in the context of preemptive thread scheduling
and of <EM>low concurrency</EM> in the context of non-preemptive thread
scheduling.
<P></P>
<DT><P><STRONG><A NAME="item_o_responsiveness"><STRONG>o</STRONG> <STRONG>responsiveness</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The responsiveness of a system can be described by the user visible
delay until the system responses to an external request. When this delay
is small enough and the user doesn't recognize a noticeable delay,
the responsiveness of the system is considered good. When the user
recognizes or is even annoyed by the delay, the responsiveness of the
system is considered bad.

<DT><P><STRONG><A NAME="item_o_reentrant%2C_thread%2Dsafe_and_asynchronous%2Dsa"><STRONG>o</STRONG> <STRONG>reentrant</STRONG>, <STRONG>thread-safe</STRONG> and <STRONG>asynchronous-safe</STRONG> functions</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">A</FONT> reentrant function is one that behaves correctly if it is called
simultaneously by several threads and then also executes simultaneously.
Functions that access global state, such as memory or files, of course,
need to be carefully designed in order to be reentrant. Two traditional
approaches to solve these problems are caller-supplied states and
thread-specific data.
<P>Thread-safety is the avoidance of <EM>data races</EM>, i.e., situations
in which data is set to either correct or incorrect value depending
upon the (unpredictable) order in which multiple threads access and
modify the data. So a function is thread-safe when it still behaves
semantically correct when called simultaneously by several threads (it
is not required that the functions also execute simultaneously). The
traditional approach to achieve thread-safety is to wrap a function body
with an internal mutual exclusion lock (aka `mutex'). As you should
recognize, reentrant is a stronger attribute than thread-safe, because
it is harder to achieve and results especially in no run-time contention
between threads. So, a reentrant function is always thread-safe, but not
vice versa.</P>
<P>Additionally there is a related attribute for functions named
asynchronous-safe, which comes into play in conjunction with signal
handlers. This is very related to the problem of reentrant functions. An
asynchronous-safe function is one that can be called safe and without
side-effects from within a signal handler context. Usually very few
functions are of this type, because an application is very restricted in
what it can perform from within a signal handler (especially what system
functions it is allowed to call). The reason mainly is, because only a
few system functions are officially declared by
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> as guaranteed to
be asynchronous-safe. Asynchronous-safe functions usually have to be
already reentrant.</P>
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="userspace threads"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">User-Space Threads</A></H2></font>
<P>User-space threads can be implemented in various way. The two
traditional approaches are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<STRONG>Matrix-based explicit dispatching between small units of execution:</STRONG>
<P>Here the global procedures of the application are split into small
execution units (each is required to not run for more than a few
milliseconds) and those units are implemented by separate functions.
Then a global matrix is defined which describes the execution (and
perhaps even dependency) order of these functions. The main server
procedure then just dispatches between these units by calling one
function after each other controlled by this matrix. The threads are
created by more than one jump-trail through this matrix and by switching
between these jump-trails controlled by corresponding occurred events.</P>
<P>This approach gives the best possible performance, because one can
fine-tune the threads of execution by adjusting the matrix, and the
scheduling is done explicitly by the application itself. It is also very
portable, because the matrix is just an ordinary data structure, and
functions are a standard feature of
<FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">C.</FONT></P>
<P>The disadvantage of this approach is that it is complicated to write
large applications with this approach, because in those applications
one quickly gets <CODE>hundreds(!)</CODE> of execution units and the control flow
inside such an application is very hard to understand (because it is
interrupted by function borders and one always has to remember the
global dispatching matrix to follow it). Additionally, all threads
operate on the same execution stack. Although this saves memory, it is
often nasty, because one cannot switch between threads in the middle of
a function. Thus the scheduling borders are the function borders.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Context-based implicit scheduling between threads of execution:</STRONG>
<P>Here the idea is that one programs the application as with forked
processes, i.e., one spawns a thread of execution and this runs from the
begin to the end without an interrupted control flow. But the control
flow can be still interrupted - even in the middle of a function.
Actually in a preemptive way, similar to what the kernel does for the
heavy-weight processes, i.e., every few milliseconds the user-space
scheduler switches between the threads of execution. But the thread
itself doesn't recognize this and usually (except for synchronization
issues) doesn't have to care about this.</P>
<P>The advantage of this approach is that it's very easy to program,
because the control flow and context of a thread directly follows
a procedure without forced interrupts through function borders.
Additionally, the programming is very similar to a traditional and well
understood <CODE>fork(2)</CODE> based approach.</P>
<P>The disadvantage is that although the general performance is increased,
compared to using approaches based on heavy-weight processes, it is decreased
compared to the matrix-approach above. Because the implicit preemptive
scheduling does usually a lot more context switches (every user-space context
switch costs some overhead even when it is a lot cheaper than a kernel-level
context switch) than the explicit cooperative/non-preemptive scheduling.
Finally, there is no really portable
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX/ANSI-C</FONT> based way to implement
user-space preemptive threading. Either the platform already has threads,
or one has to hope that some semi-portable package exists for it. And
even those semi-portable packages usually have to deal with assembler
code and other nasty internals and are not easy to port to forthcoming
platforms.</P>
<P></P></OL>
<P>So, in short: the matrix-dispatching approach is portable and fast, but
nasty to program. The thread scheduling approach is easy to program,
but suffers from synchronization and portability problems caused by its
preemptive nature.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the compromise of pth"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Compromise of Pth</A></H2></font>
<P>But why not combine the good aspects of both approaches while avoiding
their bad aspects? That's the goal of <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>. <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> implements
easy-to-program threads of execution, but avoids the problems of
preemptive scheduling by using non-preemptive scheduling instead.</P>
<P>This sounds like, and is, a useful approach. Nevertheless, one has to
keep the implications of non-preemptive thread scheduling in mind when
working with <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>. The following list summarizes a few essential
points:</P>
<DL>
<DT><P><STRONG><A NAME="item_o"><STRONG>o</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<STRONG>Pth provides maximum portability, but
<FONT SIZE="-1">NOT</FONT> the fanciest features</STRONG>.
<P>This is, because it uses a nifty and portable
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX/ANSI-C</FONT> approach for
thread creation (and this way doesn't require any platform dependent
assembler hacks) and schedules the threads in non-preemptive way (which
doesn't require unportable facilities like <CODE>SIGVTALRM</CODE>). On the other
hand, this way not all fancy threading features can be implemented.
Nevertheless the available facilities are enough to provide a robust and
full-featured threading system.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><P><STRONG><STRONG>o</STRONG></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<STRONG>Pth increases the responsiveness and concurrency of an event-driven
application, but
<FONT SIZE="-1">NOT</FONT> the concurrency of number-crunching applications</STRONG>.
<P>The reason is the non-preemptive scheduling. Number-crunching
applications usually require preemptive scheduling to achieve
concurrency because of their long
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> bursts. For them, non-preemptive
scheduling (even together with explicit yielding) provides only the old
concept of `coroutines'. On the other hand, event driven applications
benefit greatly from non-preemptive scheduling. They have only short
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> bursts and lots of events to wait on, and this way run faster under
non-preemptive scheduling because no unnecessary context switching
occurs, as it is the case for preemptive scheduling. That's why <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>
is mainly intended for server type applications, although there is no
technical restriction.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><P><STRONG><STRONG>o</STRONG></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<STRONG>Pth requires thread-safe functions, but
<FONT SIZE="-1">NOT</FONT> reentrant functions</STRONG>.
<P>This nice fact exists again because of the nature of non-preemptive
scheduling, where a function isn't interrupted and this way cannot be
reentered before it returned. This is a great portability benefit,
because thread-safety can be achieved more easily than reentrance
possibility. Especially this means that under <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> more existing
third-party libraries can be used without side-effects than its the case
for other threading systems.</P>
<P></P>

<STRONG>Pth doesn't require any kernel support, but can
<FONT SIZE="-1">NOT</FONT>
benefit from multiprocessor machines</STRONG>.
<P>This means that <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> runs on almost all Unix kernels, because the
kernel does not need to be aware of the <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> threads (because they
are implemented entirely in user-space). On the other hand, it cannot
benefit from the existence of multiprocessors, because for this, kernel
support would be needed. In practice, this is no problem, because
multiprocessor systems are rare, and portability is almost more
important than highest concurrency.</P>

<H2><A NAME="the life cycle of a thread"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The life cycle of a thread</A></H2></font>
<P>To understand the <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> Application Programming Interface
<FONT SIZE="-1">(API),</FONT> it
helps to first understand the life cycle of a thread in the <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>
threading system. It can be illustrated with the following directed
graph:</P>
<PRE>
             NEW
              |
              V
      +---&gt; READY ---+
      |       ^      |
      |       |      V
   WAITING &lt;--+-- RUNNING
                     |
      :              V
   SUSPENDED       DEAD</PRE>
<P>When a new thread is created, it is moved into the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">NEW</FONT></STRONG> queue of the
scheduler. On the next dispatching for this thread, the scheduler picks
it up from there and moves it to the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">READY</FONT></STRONG> queue. This is a queue
containing all threads which want to perform a
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> burst. There they are
queued in priority order. On each dispatching step, the scheduler always
removes the thread with the highest priority only. It then increases the
priority of all remaining threads by 1, to prevent them from `starving'.</P>
<P>The thread which was removed from the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">READY</FONT></STRONG> queue is the new
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">RUNNING</FONT></STRONG> thread (there is always just one <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">RUNNING</FONT></STRONG> thread, of
course). The <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">RUNNING</FONT></STRONG> thread is assigned execution control. After
this thread yields execution (either explicitly by yielding execution
or implicitly by calling a function which would block) there are three
possibilities: Either it has terminated, then it is moved to the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">DEAD</FONT></STRONG>
queue, or it has events on which it wants to wait, then it is moved into
the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">WAITING</FONT></STRONG> queue. Else it is assumed it wants to perform more
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>
bursts and immediately enters the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">READY</FONT></STRONG> queue again.</P>
<P>Before the next thread is taken out of the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">READY</FONT></STRONG> queue, the
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">WAITING</FONT></STRONG> queue is checked for pending events. If one or more events
occurred, the threads that are waiting on them are immediately moved to
the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">READY</FONT></STRONG> queue.</P>
<P>The purpose of the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">NEW</FONT></STRONG> queue has to do with the fact that in <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>
a thread never directly switches to another thread.
<FONT SIZE="-1">A</FONT> thread always
yields execution to the scheduler and the scheduler dispatches to the
next thread. So a freshly spawned thread has to be kept somewhere until
the scheduler gets a chance to pick it up for scheduling. That is for
what the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">NEW</FONT></STRONG> queue is for.</P>
<P>The purpose of the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">DEAD</FONT></STRONG> queue is to support thread joining. When a
thread is marked to be unjoinable, it is directly kicked out of the
system after it terminated. But when it is joinable, it enters the
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">DEAD</FONT></STRONG> queue. There it remains until another thread joins it.</P>
<P>Finally, there is a special separated queue named <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">SUSPENDED</FONT></STRONG>, to where
threads can be manually moved from the <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">NEW</FONT></STRONG>, <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">READY</FONT></STRONG> or <STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">WAITING</FONT></STRONG>
queues by the application. The purpose of this special queue is to
temporarily absorb suspended threads until they are again resumed by
the application. Suspended threads do not cost scheduling or event
handling resources, because they are temporarily completely out of the
scheduler's scope. If a thread is resumed, it is moved back to the queue
from where it originally came and this way again enters the schedulers
scope.</P>

This initializes the <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> library. It has to be the first <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT>
function call in an application, and is mandatory. It's usually done at
the begin of the <CODE>main()</CODE> function of the application. This implicitly
spawns the internal scheduler thread and transforms the single execution

<FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> function call
in an application, but is not really required. It's usually done at the end of
the main function of the application. At least, it has to be called from within
the main thread. It implicitly kills all threads and transforms back the
calling thread into the single execution unit of the underlying process. The
usual way to terminate a <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> application is either a simple
`<A HREF="#item_pth_exit"><CODE>pth_exit(0);</CODE></A>' in the main thread (which waits for all other threads to
terminate, kills the threading system and then terminates the process) or a
`<A HREF="#item_pth_kill"><CODE>pth_kill(); exit(0)</CODE></A>' (which immediately kills the threading system and
terminates the process). The <A HREF="#item_pth_kill"><CODE>pth_kill()</CODE></A> return immediately with a return

This requires a second argument of type `<CODE>float *</CODE>' (pointer to a floating

averaged load of the scheduler in this variable. The load is a function from
the number of threads in the ready queue of the schedulers dispatching unit.
So a load around 1.0 means there is only one ready thread (the standard
situation when the application has no high load).
<FONT SIZE="-1">A</FONT> higher load value means
there a more threads ready who want to do

This explicitly yields back the execution control to the scheduler thread.
Usually the execution is implicitly transferred back to the scheduler when a
thread waits for an event. But when a thread has to do larger
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> bursts, it
can be reasonable to interrupt it explicitly by doing a few <A HREF="#item_pth_yield"><CODE>pth_yield(3)</CODE></A> calls
to give other threads a chance to execute, too. This obviously is the
cooperating part of <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>.
<FONT SIZE="-1">A</FONT> thread <EM>has not</EM> to yield execution, of
course. But when you want to program a server application with good response
times the threads should be cooperative, i.e., when they should split their
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>
bursts into smaller units with this call.
<P>Usually one specifies <EM>tid</EM> as <CODE>NULL</CODE> to indicate to the scheduler that it
can freely decide which thread to dispatch next. But if one wants to indicate
to the scheduler that a particular thread should be favored on the next
dispatching step, one can specify this thread explicitly. This allows the
usage of the old concept of <EM>coroutines</EM> where a thread/routine switches to a
particular cooperating thread. If <EM>tid</EM> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> and points to a <EM>new</EM>
or <EM>ready</EM> thread, it is guaranteed that this thread receives execution
control on the next dispatching step. If <EM>tid</EM> is in a different state (that
is, not in <CODE>PTH_STATE_NEW</CODE> or <CODE>PTH_STATE_READY</CODE>) an error is reported.</P>
<P>The function usually returns <CODE>TRUE</CODE> for success and only <CODE>FALSE</CODE> (with

This functions suspends the execution of the current thread until <EM>naptime</EM>

a resolution of one microsecond. In practice you should neither rely on this

of the non-preemptive nature of <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> it can last longer (when another thread
kept the

implementation of timers by the operating system and these usually have only a

to be occurred (using

This function declares forking handlers to be called before and after

<EM>parent</EM> handler is called after <CODE>fork(2)</CODE> processing completes in the parent
process. The <EM>child</EM> handler is called after <CODE>fork(2)</CODE> processing completed in
the child process. If no handling is desired at one or more of these three
points, the corresponding handler can be given as <CODE>NULL</CODE>. Each handler is
called with <EM>arg</EM> as the argument.
<P>The order of calls to <A HREF="#item_pth_atfork_push"><CODE>pth_atfork_push(3)</CODE></A> is significant. The <EM>parent</EM> and

This is a variant of <CODE>fork(2)</CODE> with the difference that the current thread only
is forked into a separate process, i.e., in the parent process nothing changes
while in the child process all threads are gone except for the scheduler and
the calling thread. When you really want to duplicate all threads in the
current process you should use <CODE>fork(2)</CODE> directly. But this is usually not
reasonable. Additionally this function takes care of forking handlers as
established by pth_fork_push(3).

<P>The following functions provide synchronization support via mutual exclusion
locks (<STRONG>mutex</STRONG>), read-write locks (<STRONG>rwlock</STRONG>), condition variables (<STRONG>cond</STRONG>)
and barriers (<STRONG>barrier</STRONG>). Keep in mind that in a non-preemptive threading
system like <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> this might sound unnecessary at the first look, because a
thread isn't interrupted by the system. Actually when you have a critical code
section which doesn't contain any <CODE>pth_xxx()</CODE> functions, you don't need any
mutex to protect it, of course.</P>
<P>But when your critical code section contains any <CODE>pth_xxx()</CODE> function the chance
is high that these temporarily switch to the scheduler. And this way other
threads can make progress and enter your critical code section, too. This is
especially true for critical code sections which implicitly or explicitly use
the event mechanism.</P>

This is a variant of the

shell command <EM>cmd</EM> with Bourne Shell (<CODE>sh</CODE>) and suspends the current

<CODE>system(3)</CODE> and <A HREF="#item_pth_system"><CODE>pth_system(3)</CODE></A> is that that <A HREF="#item_pth_system"><CODE>pth_system(3)</CODE></A> suspends only

pthread_sigmask(3). The arguments <EM>how</EM>, <EM>set</EM> and <EM>oset</EM> directly relate
to sigprocmask(2), because <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> internally just uses <CODE>sigprocmask(2)</CODE> here. So

This is a variant of the POSIX.1c <CODE>sigwait(3)</CODE> function. It suspends the current
threads execution until a signal in <EM>set</EM> occurred and stores the signal
number in <EM>sig</EM>. The important point is that the signal is not delivered to a
signal handler. Instead it's caught by the scheduler only in order to awake
the <A HREF="#item_pth_sigwait"><CODE>pth_sigwait()</CODE></A> call. The trick and noticeable point here is that this way
you get an asynchronous aware application that is written completely
synchronously. When you think about the problem of <EM>asynchronous safe</EM>
functions you should recognize that this is a great benefit.

<H1><A NAME="build environments">
<FONT SIZE="-1">BUILD</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">ENVIRONMENTS</FONT></A></H1>
<P>In this section we will discuss the canonical ways to establish the build
environment for a <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> based program. The possibilities supported by <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>
range from very simple environments to rather complex ones.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="manual build environment (novice)"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Manual Build Environment (Novice)</A></H2></font>
<P>As a first example, assume we have the above test program staying in the
source file <CODE>foo.c</CODE>. Then we can create a very simple build environment by
just adding the following <CODE>Makefile</CODE>:</P>
<PRE>
 $ vi Makefile
 | CC      = cc
 | CFLAGS  = `pth-config --cflags`
 | LDFLAGS = `pth-config --ldflags`
 | LIBS    = `pth-config --libs`
 |
 | all: foo
 | foo: foo.o
 |     $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
 | foo.o: foo.c
 |     $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
 | clean:
 |     rm -f foo foo.o</PRE>
<P>This imports the necessary compiler and linker flags on-the-fly from the
<STRONG>Pth</STRONG> installation via its <CODE>pth-config</CODE> program. This approach is
straight-forward and works fine for small projects.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="autoconf build environment (advanced)"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Autoconf Build Environment (Advanced)</A></H2></font>
<P>The previous approach is simple but unflexible. First, to speed up
building, it would be nice to not expand the compiler and linker flags
every time the compiler is started. Second, it would be useful to
also be able to build against an uninstalled <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>, that is, against
a <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> source tree which was just configured and built, but not
installed. Third, it would be also useful to allow checking of the
<STRONG>Pth</STRONG> version to make sure it is at least a minimum required version.
And finally, it would be also great to make sure <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> works correctly
by first performing some sanity compile and run-time checks. All this
can be done if we use
<FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG> and the <CODE>AC_CHECK_PTH</CODE> macro
provided by <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>. For this, we establish the following three files:</P>
<P>First we again need the <CODE>Makefile</CODE>, but this time it contains <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG>
placeholders and additional cleanup targets. And we create it under the name
<CODE>Makefile.in</CODE>, because it is now an input file for <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG>:</P>
<PRE>
 $ vi Makefile.in
 | CC      = @CC@
 | CFLAGS  = @CFLAGS@
 | LDFLAGS = @LDFLAGS@
 | LIBS    = @LIBS@
 |
 | all: foo
 | foo: foo.o
 |     $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
 | foo.o: foo.c
 |     $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
 | clean:
 |     rm -f foo foo.o
 | distclean:
 |     rm -f foo foo.o
 |     rm -f config.log config.status config.cache
 |     rm -f Makefile</PRE>
<P>Because <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG> generates additional files, we added a canonical
<CODE>distclean</CODE> target which cleanups this, too. Second, we write
a (minimalistic) <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG> script specification in a file
<CODE>configure.in</CODE>:</P>
<PRE>
 $ vi configure.in
 | AC_INIT(Makefile.in)
 | AC_CHECK_PTH(1.3.0)
 | AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)</PRE>
<P>Then we let <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG>'s <CODE>aclocal</CODE> program generate for us an <CODE>aclocal.m4</CODE>
file containing <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>'s <CODE>AC_CHECK_PTH</CODE> macro. Then we generate the final
<CODE>configure</CODE> script out of this <CODE>aclocal.m4</CODE> file and the <CODE>configure.in</CODE>
file:</P>
<PRE>
 $ aclocal --acdir=`pth-config --acdir`
 $ autoconf</PRE>
<P>After these steps, the working directory should look similar to this:</P>
<PRE>
 $ ls -l
 -rw-r--r--  1 rse  users    176 Nov  3 11:11 Makefile.in
 -rw-r--r--  1 rse  users  15314 Nov  3 11:16 aclocal.m4

 -rw-r--r--  1 rse  users   4227 Nov  3 11:11 foo.c</PRE>
<P>If we now run <CODE>configure</CODE> we get a correct <CODE>Makefile</CODE> which
immediately can be used to build <CODE>foo</CODE> (assuming that <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> is already
installed somewhere, so that <CODE>pth-config</CODE> is in <CODE>$PATH</CODE>):</P>

<P>If <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> is installed in non-standard locations or <CODE>pth-config</CODE>
is not in <CODE>$PATH</CODE>, one just has to drop the <CODE>configure</CODE> script
a note about the location by running <CODE>configure</CODE> with the option
<CODE>--with-pth=</CODE><EM>dir</EM> (where <EM>dir</EM> is the argument which was used with
the <CODE>--prefix</CODE> option when <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> was installed).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="autoconf build environment with local copy of pth (expert)"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Autoconf Build Environment with Local Copy of Pth (Expert)</A></H2></font>
<P>Finally let us assume the <CODE>foo</CODE> program stays under either a <EM>
<FONT SIZE="-1">GPL</FONT></EM> or
<EM>
<FONT SIZE="-1">LGPL</FONT></EM> distribution license and we want to make it a stand-alone package for
easier distribution and installation. That is, we don't want that the
end-user first has to install <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> just to allow our <CODE>foo</CODE> package to
compile. For this, it is a convenient practice to include the required
libraries (here <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>) into the source tree of the package (here <CODE>foo</CODE>).
<STRONG>Pth</STRONG> ships with all necessary support to allow us to easily achieve this
approach. Say, we want <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> in a subdirectory named <CODE>pth/</CODE> and this
directory should be seamlessly integrated into the configuration and build
process of <CODE>foo</CODE>.</P>
<P>First we again start with the <CODE>Makefile.in</CODE>, but this time it is a more
advanced version which supports subdirectory movement:</P>
<PRE>
 $ vi Makefile.in
 | CC      = @CC@
 | CFLAGS  = @CFLAGS@
 | LDFLAGS = @LDFLAGS@
 | LIBS    = @LIBS@
 |
 | SUBDIRS = pth
 |
 | all: subdirs_all foo
 |
 | subdirs_all:
 |     @$(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) subdirs TARGET=all
 | subdirs_clean:
 |     @$(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) subdirs TARGET=clean
 | subdirs_distclean:
 |     @$(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) subdirs TARGET=distclean
 | subdirs:
 |     @for subdir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
 |         echo &quot;===&gt; $$subdir ($(TARGET))&quot;; \
 |         (cd $$subdir; $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) $(TARGET) || exit 1) || exit 1; \
 |         echo &quot;&lt;=== $$subdir&quot;; \
 |     done
 |
 | foo: foo.o
 |     $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
 | foo.o: foo.c
 |     $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
 |
 | clean: subdirs_clean
 |     rm -f foo foo.o
 | distclean: subdirs_distclean
 |     rm -f foo foo.o
 |     rm -f config.log config.status config.cache
 |     rm -f Makefile</PRE>
<P>Then we create a slightly different <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG> script <CODE>configure.in</CODE>:</P>
<PRE>
 $ vi configure.in
 | AC_INIT(Makefile.in)
 | AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(pth)
 | AC_CHECK_PTH(1.3.0, subdir:pth --disable-tests)
 | AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS(pth)
 | AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)</PRE>
<P>Here we provided a default value for <CODE>foo</CODE>'s <CODE>--with-pth</CODE> option as the
second argument to <CODE>AC_CHECK_PTH</CODE> which indicates that <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> can be found in
the subdirectory named <CODE>pth/</CODE>. Additionally we specified that the
<CODE>--disable-tests</CODE> option of <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> should be passed to the <CODE>pth/</CODE>
subdirectory, because we need only to build the <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> library itself. And we
added a <CODE>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIR</CODE> call which indicates to <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG> that it should
configure the <CODE>pth/</CODE> subdirectory, too. The <CODE>AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR</CODE> directive
was added just to make <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG> happy, because it wants to find a
<CODE>install.sh</CODE> or <CODE>shtool</CODE> script if <CODE>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</CODE> is used.</P>
<P>Now we let <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG>'s <CODE>aclocal</CODE> program again generate for us an
<CODE>aclocal.m4</CODE> file with the contents of <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>'s <CODE>AC_CHECK_PTH</CODE> macro.
Finally we generate the <CODE>configure</CODE> script out of this <CODE>aclocal.m4</CODE>
file and the <CODE>configure.in</CODE> file.</P>
<PRE>
 $ aclocal --acdir=`pth-config --acdir`
 $ autoconf</PRE>
<P>Now we have to create the <CODE>pth/</CODE> subdirectory itself. For this, we extract the
<STRONG>Pth</STRONG> distribution to the <CODE>foo</CODE> source tree and just rename it to <CODE>pth/</CODE>:</P>
<PRE>
 $ gunzip &lt;pth-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xvf -
 $ mv pth-X.Y.Z pth</PRE>
<P>Optionally to reduce the size of the <CODE>pth/</CODE> subdirectory, we can strip down
the <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> sources to a minimum with the <EM>striptease</EM> feature:</P>
<PRE>
 $ cd pth
 $ ./configure
 $ make striptease
 $ cd ..</PRE>
<P>After this the source tree of <CODE>foo</CODE> should look similar to this:</P>

<P>As you can see, <STRONG>autoconf</STRONG> now automatically configures the local
(stripped down) copy of <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> in the subdirectory <CODE>pth/</CODE> and the
<CODE>Makefile</CODE> automatically builds the subdirectory, too.</P>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="system call wrapper facility">
<FONT SIZE="-1">SYSTEM</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CALL</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">WRAPPER</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">FACILITY</FONT></A></H1>
<P><STRONG>Pth</STRONG> per default uses an explicit
<FONT SIZE="-1">API,</FONT> including the system calls. For
instance you've to explicitly use <A HREF="#item_pth_read"><CODE>pth_read(3)</CODE></A> when you need a thread-aware
<CODE>read(3)</CODE> and cannot expect that by just calling <CODE>read(3)</CODE> only the current thread
is blocked. Instead with the standard <CODE>read(3)</CODE> call the whole process will be
blocked. But because for some applications (mainly those consisting of lots of
third-party stuff) this can be inconvenient. Here it's required that a call
to <CODE>read(3)</CODE> `magically' means pth_read(3). The problem here is that such
magic <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> cannot provide per default because it's not really portable.
Nevertheless <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> provides a two step approach to solve this problem:</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="soft system call mapping"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Soft System Call Mapping</A></H2></font>
<P>This variant is available on all platforms and can <EM>always</EM> be enabled by
building <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> with <CODE>--enable-syscall-soft</CODE>. This then triggers some
<CODE>#define</CODE>'s in the <CODE>pth.h</CODE> header which map for instance <CODE>read(3)</CODE> to
pth_read(3), etc. Currently the following functions are mapped: fork(2),
sleep(3), sigwait(3), waitpid(2), system(3), select(2), poll(2),
connect(2), accept(2), read(2), write(2), recv(2), send(2), recvfrom(2),
sendto(2).</P>
<P>The drawback of this approach is just that really all source files
of the application where these function calls occur have to include
<CODE>pth.h</CODE>, of course. And this also means that existing libraries,
including the vendor's <STRONG>stdio</STRONG>, usually will still block the whole
process if one of its
<FONT SIZE="-1">I/O</FONT> functions block.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="hard system call mapping"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hard System Call Mapping</A></H2></font>
<P>This variant is available only on those platforms where the <CODE>syscall(2)</CODE>
function exists and there it can be enabled by building <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> with
<CODE>--enable-syscall-hard</CODE>. This then builds wrapper functions (for instances
<CODE>read(3))</CODE> into the <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> library which internally call the real <STRONG>Pth</STRONG>
replacement functions (pth_read(3)). Currently the following functions
are mapped: fork(2), sleep(3), waitpid(2), system(3), select(2),
poll(2), connect(2), accept(2), read(2), write(2).</P>
<P>The drawback of this approach is that it depends on <CODE>syscall(2)</CODE> interface
and prototype conflicts can occur while building the wrapper functions
due to different function signatures in the vendor
<FONT SIZE="-1">C</FONT> header files.
But the advantage of this mapping variant is that the source files of
the application where these function calls occur have not to include
<CODE>pth.h</CODE> and that existing libraries, including the vendor's <STRONG>stdio</STRONG>,
magically become thread-aware (and then block only the current thread).</P>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="implementation notes">
<FONT SIZE="-1">IMPLEMENTATION</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTES</FONT></A></H1>
<P><STRONG>Pth</STRONG> is very portable because it has only one part which perhaps has
to be ported to new platforms (the machine context initialization). But
it is written in a way which works on mostly all Unix platforms which
support <CODE>makecontext(2)</CODE> or at least <CODE>sigstack(2)</CODE> or <CODE>sigaltstack(2)</CODE> [see
<CODE>pth_mctx.c</CODE> for details]. Any other <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> code is
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> and
<FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">C</FONT>
based only.</P>
<P>The context switching is done via either SUSv2 <CODE>makecontext(2)</CODE> or
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT>
make[sig]setjmp(3) and [sig]longjmp(3). Here all
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> registers, the
program counter and the stack pointer are switched. Additionally the
<STRONG>Pth</STRONG> dispatcher switches also the global Unix <CODE>errno</CODE> variable [see
<CODE>pth_mctx.c</CODE> for details] and the signal mask (either implicitly via
<CODE>sigsetjmp(3)</CODE> or in an emulated way via explicit <CODE>setprocmask(2)</CODE> calls).</P>
<P>The <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> event manager is mainly <CODE>select(2)</CODE> and <CODE>gettimeofday(2)</CODE> based,
i.e., the current time is fetched via <CODE>gettimeofday(2)</CODE> once per context
switch for time calculations and all
<FONT SIZE="-1">I/O</FONT> events are implemented via a
single central <CODE>select(2)</CODE> call [see <CODE>pth_sched.c</CODE> for details].</P>
<P>The thread control block management is done via virtual priority
queues without any additional data structure overhead. For this, the
queue linkage attributes are part of the thread control blocks and the
queues are actually implemented as rings with a selected element as the
entry point [see <CODE>pth_tcb.h</CODE> and <CODE>pth_pqueue.c</CODE> for details].</P>
<P>Most time critical code sections (especially the dispatcher and event
manager) are speeded up by inlined functions (implemented as
<FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">C</FONT>
pre-processor macros). Additionally any debugging code is <EM>completely</EM>
removed from the source when not built with <CODE>-DPTH_DEBUG</CODE> (see Autoconf
<CODE>--enable-debug</CODE> option), i.e., not only stub functions remain [see
<CODE>pth_debug.h</CODE> for details].</P>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="restrictions">
<FONT SIZE="-1">RESTRICTIONS</FONT></A></H1>
<P><STRONG>Pth</STRONG> (intentionally) provides no replacements for non-thread-safe
functions (like <CODE>strtok(3)</CODE> which uses a static internal buffer) or
synchronous system functions (like <CODE>gethostbyname(3)</CODE> which doesn't
provide an asynchronous mode where it doesn't block). When you want to
use those functions in your server application together with threads,
you've to either link the application against special third-party
libraries (or for thread-safe/reentrant functions possibly against an
existing <CODE>libc_r</CODE> of the platform vendor). For an asynchronous
<FONT SIZE="-1">DNS</FONT>
resolver library use the
<FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> <STRONG>adns</STRONG> package from Ian Jackson ( see
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/adns/adns.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/adns/adns.html</A> ).</P>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="history">
<FONT SIZE="-1">HISTORY</FONT></A></H1>
<P>The <STRONG>Pth</STRONG> library was designed and implemented between February and
July 1999 by <EM>Ralf
<FONT SIZE="-1">S.</FONT> Engelschall</EM> after evaluating numerous (mostly
preemptive) thread libraries and after intensive discussions with
<EM>Peter Simons</EM>, <EM>Martin Kraemer</EM>, <EM>Lars Eilebrecht</EM> and <EM>Ralph
Babel</EM> related to an experimental (matrix based) non-preemptive
<FONT SIZE="-1">C++</FONT>
scheduler class written by <EM>Peter Simons</EM>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Pth</STRONG> was then implemented in order to combine the <EM>non-preemptive</EM>
approach of multithreading (which provides better portability and
performance) with an
<FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> similar to the popular one found in <STRONG>Pthread</STRONG>
libraries (which provides easy programming).</P>
<P>So the essential idea of the non-preemptive approach was taken over from
<EM>Peter Simons</EM> scheduler. The priority based scheduling algorithm was
suggested by <EM>Martin Kraemer</EM>. Some code inspiration also came from
an experimental threading library (<STRONG>rsthreads</STRONG>) written by <EM>Robert
<FONT SIZE="-1">S.</FONT> Thau</EM> for an ancient internal test version of the Apache webserver.
The concept and
<FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> of message ports was borrowed from AmigaOS' <STRONG>Exec</STRONG>
subsystem. The concept and idea for the flexible event mechanism came
from <EM>Paul Vixie</EM>'s <STRONG>eventlib</STRONG> (which can be found as a part of
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE="-1">BIND</FONT></STRONG> v8).</P>
